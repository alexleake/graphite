although i do used some collectd modules to get ceph basics
(i.e. OSD count), i found most scripts to either report
ceph stats incorrectly - or in a format which was not so 
easy to understand.

the script "ceph_iostat" does a rolling diff of some major
cluster statistics (IOPs / kb(r) / kb(w)) so that you can
easily tell which pool is using the most cluster time...
