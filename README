these scripts all save data into graphite unsing the correct timestamp.

each loop will get a new timestamp, so execution time doesn't matter so much - however please ensure ntp works as expected.

to actually contruct dashboards i would highly recommend looking into grafana.

if you have puppet there are two excellent modules to set up a working graphite / grafana instance:

and
